# Web3 Project Launch Strategy: Why Community Precedes Code.

## The Case Study of Axie Infinity Proves That Shared Ownership is the Only Sustainable Path to Scale.

As a **Digital Marketing Strategist focused on the Web3 space**, I see a fundamental strategic failure that plagues new projects: **NFT Collections that launch art before building a community.** This mirrors the common 2021 pattern of projects minting first, promising utility later, and inevitably collapsing due to the lack of a core, invested audience.

### The Lesson from Axie Infinity

The antidote is best illustrated by **Axie Infinity** (2018-2021). Despite having no marketing budget and simple initial technology, they achieved massive scale because the founders lived inside their Discord, manually helping users and empowering community leaders. They didn't pay for content; the community created the content (guides, bots, guilds) organically.

The key lesson for all founders and builders: The "Scholarship Model" and the massive cultural presence Axie gained were a direct result of this grassroots investment. **The community became the growth engine.**

### My Core Conviction

My core conviction on this topic is simple: **We win by building together.** Web3 has fundamentally made the customer the co-owner. As strategists and analysts, our role is to facilitate that ownership through transparent, educational communication and robust systems.
